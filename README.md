 This code implements a simple billing system in Python. It consists of two classes: Product and BillingSystem.  The Product class represents individual products with attributes like name, price, quantity, and day.  The BillingSystem class manages the billing process with methods to add products, calculate the total price, and print receipts.  The code creates an instance of the BillingSystem class and enters a loop. Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter product details. Each product is added to the billing system, and a receipt is printed. The loop continues until the user chooses to stop.  Finally, a "Thank you" message is displayed.  In summary, this code allows for the management of products, calculation of total prices, and printing of receipts in a basic billing system
